To run TicTacToe.cpp, first compile it using ```g++ TicTacToe.cpp -o TicTacToe```
Then run the executable using "./TicTacToe"

This will then display the board (which will be empty to start) and give player X the prompt to input the row and column they would like to play in (1-indexed).  
Then players take turns playing in locations they choose until the game is over.  
When a player has won, type Ctrl + c to exit the game.
